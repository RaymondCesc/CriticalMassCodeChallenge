# CriticalMassCodeChallenge

Critical Mass Internship task/code challenge

1. Work/Project Examples
•	Development of a Travel Experts website prototype for a travel company that stores information of customers, suppliers, sales and commission, and also manages customers bookings. Customers have the flexibility of browsing through the available vacation packages and book any of the packages they are comfortable with. Technology used for this project include HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, javaScript, Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB database. For this web application, I was responsible for the 'Registration' and 'Contact Us' page.  Travel experts customers who are interested in booking a package must first register before they will be able to do so. When a customer creates an account, the program checks the database whether the account already exists. If it does not, the new account is created, while if it already exists, an exception is thrown at the user. Also, the registration fields are validated. For example, an error is thrown if you try to submit a blank registration page or you fail to supply info in the required fields. 
The 'Contact Us' contains the office addresses of the agents, their phone number and emails, as well as a list of the different agents working in each agency. These information are dynamically generated from the database.

•	Developed a simple windows application for Travel Experts employees to administer/manage the data stored in their database. They will   be able to add/edit products, vacation packages, suppliers and product-suppliers. 
  This project was divided among my team consisting of 4 members, with each member responsible for one table. I was responsible for developing the suppliers table. The supplier table contains the names and ID of suppliers supplying vacation products/packages to travel experts. Technology used was C# and MS SQL, and ADO.NET objects for data access. To access the Travel Experts database,a Sqlconnection is established ,to read the suppliers information from the SQL database. The employees can use the 'New' button to add a new supplier record, the 'edit' button to edit existing suppliers information. 

•	Developed a fully functional, responsive, user friendly Web Application for Travel Experts customers (mostly retired Seniors) to view   listings of the products they purchased with travel experts. We built this easy to use web app using ASP.NET MVC. I was responsible here for the 'About Us' page and the customer Login. The About us page gives a brief overview of the Travel company.  The login permits an existing customer to login to website and view a listing of their travel products. When a customer tries to login, the system checks the database to see if the information already exist. If it does, access is granted otherwise it is declined.

2. INSPIRATION

(i) UBER Technologies
Uber, a ride-hailing company is one of the few technologies that has really inspired me. The company offers services that includes peer-to-peer ridesharing, ride service hailing, food delivery and a micro-mobility system with electric bikes and scooters. Uber is valued roughly at US$66 billion, and has established branches in over 521 cities in over 82 countries.  
What mostly inspires me about Uber is the way the ride-hailing company is changing the dynamics of the transportation industry. It runs this multi - billion dollar industry with just a simple App, without owning a single vehicle. When you think about how simple the Uber model really is, the possibilities are endless. There is absolutely no limit to what we can achieve with technology.
According to The New York Times, app-driven businesses like Uber are changing the way we think about certain services. Uber has shown the business world that some professions can be broken down into tasks-services performed on demand by people with the tools and spare time to do so.

(ii) Shazam 
Shazam an application owned and developed by Apple Inc is another technology that has really inspired me recently.  The application can identify music, movies, advertising and television shows, based on a short sample played and using the microphone on the device. Shazam identifies songs based on an audio fingerprint based on a time-frequency graph called a spectrogram. The software is available for Android, macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS, and windows. 
What began as a utility to answer “what is that song?” is now one of the world’s most popular mobile experiences where people can discover more about music and share what they find with their friends. People can hear a song they like and buy it in that moment of inspiration.
This “instant gratification” capability translated into Shazam driving more than $300 million in digital music sales in 2013, accounting for 7% of all digital music sales worldwide. It also generates an amazing amount of data and insight about what people like.


(iii) Google Maps
Google maps, a web mapping service developed by google has affected our lives in so many positive ways. Long gone are the days when travellers got lost in the back streets of Calgary, fumbling through their phrasebooks as they pumped locals for directions. Unquestionably, the digital map has revolutionised the ease with which we can travel , whether it be by car, boat, plane, train or foot. 
According to tourism expert Ulrike Gretzel from the University of Queensland, “We increasingly depend on technology for navigation, which takes some of the important serendipity out of the travel equation.
Google maps helps me to beat traffic a lot of times, even in peak hours. It gives me updates on the traffic condition of my route,and in most times provides an alternative route whenever there is congestion.. Google maps does not only provide direction throughout my journey, it also makes me aware of what’s happening in my environment. For example, it tells me when there is a crash ahead, when there is a speed or mobile camera. These are amazing stuffs! 


3. If I am given the available resources and time, I would love to build on my frontend development skills by learning React.js JavaScript framework. React.js is one of the in-demand frontend development library for building user interface in a predictable and efficient way. This library was not icluded in my course schedule so I didn't have the opportunity to learn it. I am willing and eager to learn this framework, so I would be able to build a fully functional, responsive, user friendly, world class web application solution for any of CM clients.
To achieve this, firstly, I need to fully understand the business of Critical Mass and its processes of meeting the needs of its clients as this is key to developing effective and efficient customer solutions. The first few days of my time would be dedicated to this- reading extensively about the company, it’s clients, services it provides, review some of the company’s past works to understand its business process. Next step would be learning React.js and taking up real time challenges/projects on application of my technical skills.
